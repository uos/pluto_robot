    # REP-105 (http://www.ros.org/reps/rep-0105.html) specifies four principal coordinate frames: base_link, odom, map, and
    # earth. base_link is the coordinate frame that is affixed to the robot. Both odom and map are world-fixed frames.
    # The robot's position in the odom frame will drift over time, but is accurate in the short term and should be
    # continuous. The odom frame is therefore the best frame for executing local motion plans. The map frame, like the odom
    # frame, is a world-fixed coordinate frame, and while it contains the most globally accurate position estimate for your
    # robot, it is subject to discrete jumps, e.g., due to the fusion of GPS data or a correction from a map-based
    # localization node. The earth frame is used to relate multiple map frames by giving them a common reference frame.
    # ekf_localization_node and ukf_localization_node are not concerned with the earth frame.
    # Here is how to use the following settings:
    # 1. Set the map_frame, odom_frame, and base_link frames to the appropriate frame names for your system.
    #     1a. If your system does not have a map_frame, just remove it, and make sure "world_frame" is set to the value of
    #         odom_frame.
    # 2. If you are fusing continuous position data such as wheel encoder odometry, visual odometry, or IMU data, set
    #   "world_frame" to your odom_frame value. This is the default behavior for robot_localization's state estimation nodes.
    # 3. If you are fusing global absolute position data that is subject to discrete jumps (e.g., GPS or position updates
    # from landmark observations) then:
    #     3a. Set your "world_frame" to your map_frame value
    #     3b. MAKE SURE something else is generating the odom->base_link transform. Note that this can even be another state
    #         estimation node from robot_localization! However, that instance should *not* fuse the global data.
